The API is build for integrating the VISSIM and SUMO simlators with the NS3.

VISSIM traffic data can be txt file or csv file.

SUMO file is the converted to xml file after extracting the traffic data using OSM.

Two resulting files are uploaded in the TCL format.

Test_VISSIM.tcl is a traffic data from VISSIM and the Test_SUMO.tcl is the traffic data from SUMO.

To use the tcl file, please update the obility model in Ns-3 to use Ns-2 mobility model.
